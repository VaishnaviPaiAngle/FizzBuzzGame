# FizzBuzzGame
## FizzBuzz Game using Java.</br>
FizzBuzz is a popular programming game.The game is played with numbers from 1 to a specified upper limit, typically 100.

The rules of FizzBuzz are simple:

Players take turns counting up from 1.<br>
If the current number is divisible by 3, instead of saying the number, the player says "Fizz".<br>
If the current number is divisible by 5, instead of saying the number, the player says "Buzz".<br>
If the current number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player says "FizzBuzz".<br>
If the current number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, the player simply says the number.<br>

The code takes a number as input and returns a string according to the FizzBuzz rules.<br>
It checks if the number is divisible by 3 and/or 5 and appends 'Fizz' and/or 'Buzz' accordingly.
If the number is not divisible by either 3 or 5, it returns the number itself.
